# How to use TODO.md

This file tracks the tasks for our research and development of an AI coding agent. It is structured to provide a clear overview of our objectives and progress.

## Structure

The `TODO.md` file is organized as follows:

1.  **Main Goal:** A single, high-level objective that defines the overall purpose of the project for the current phase.
2.  **Sections (Sub-Goals):** The main goal is broken down into smaller, manageable sections. Each section represents a significant sub-goal or milestone.
3.  **Questions:** Below the sub-goal, list any blocking questions that must be answered before the tasks in that section can be completed.
4.  **Tasks:** Within each section, there is a checklist of specific, actionable tasks. These tasks should be checked off as they are completed.

### Example

```markdown
# Goal: Build a prototype AI coding agent

## Phase 1: Research and Scaffolding

- [x] Define research goals
- [ ] Define project goals
- [ ] Set up project structure

### Questions
- Which framework should we start with for the initial prototype, Agno or Google ADK?


## Phase 2: Framework Evaluation

- [ ] Build a simple agent with Agno
- [ ] Build a simple agent with Google ADK
- [ ] Compare performance and developer experience
```

This structure helps us stay organized and focused on delivering value incrementally.
