# Goal: Determine the Optimal Architecture for an AI Coding Agent

## Phase 1: Define Goals and Research (Completed)

- [x] Define `code-adk/research/0-goals/research-goal.md`
- [x] Define `code-adk/research/0-goals/project-goal.md`
- [x] Synthesize research findings from existing documents.

### Questions
- [x] What are the primary research and project goals? (Answered in `code-adk/research/0-goals/`)

## Phase 2: Coding Agent Analysis

- [x] Analyze the architecture of Aider to determine if it is single-agent or multi-agent.
- [x] Analyze the architecture of Cline/Roo-Code to determine if it is single-agent or multi-agent.
- [x] Analyze the architecture of OpenHands to determine if it is single-agent or multi-agent.
- [x] Create the summary document `code-adk/research/2-analysis/coding-agent-architectures.md` with the findings.

## Future Phases: Prototyping

### Prototype Development (Single Agent)
- [ ] Choose a primary framework for the first prototype.
- [ ] Implement a basic "Hello, World" agent.
- [ ] Give the agent a simple coding task (e.g., write a function).

#### Questions
- Which framework should we use for the initial single-agent prototype: Agno or Google ADK?

### Prototype Development (Multi-Agent)
- [ ] Design a multi-agent architecture based on research (e.g., Planner-Executor).
- [ ] Implement a multi-agent system for a more complex coding task.
- [ ] Evaluate the performance and complexity of the multi-agent approach.
