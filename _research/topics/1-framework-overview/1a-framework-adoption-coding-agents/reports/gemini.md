The Framework Dilemma: Why AI Coding Agents Build Bespoke Architectures


Executive Summary

The rapid proliferation of AI coding agents has introduced a significant architectural schism: while a mature ecosystem of general-purpose agentic frameworks like LangGraph, Google ADK, and Agno exists, the most prominent and performant coding agents—such as Aider, OpenHands, and the influential Devin—are predominantly built on bespoke, custom frameworks. This report provides an exhaustive investigation into this phenomenon, concluding that the decision to build rather than buy is not a manifestation of "Not-Invented-Here" syndrome but a calculated engineering necessity. It is driven by the unique, high-fidelity demands of the software development domain, which current general-purpose frameworks are not architected to meet with the required precision and performance.
The analysis identifies five principal reasons compelling the development of custom frameworks for AI coding agents:
Fine-Grained Execution Control: The iterative and often unpredictable nature of coding requires absolute control over the agent's internal execution loop, including nuanced error handling, context management, and multi-step tool interactions. Custom frameworks allow developers to design specialized pipelines, such as Aider's Architect/Editor model, that are optimized for coding tasks, a level of control often obscured by the higher-level abstractions of general frameworks.
Specialized State Management for Iterative Development: Software development is a long-running, non-linear process of refinement, testing, and debugging. This necessitates a sophisticated state management model capable of tracking file versions, test outcomes, error logs, and an evolving strategic plan across thousands of steps. Custom solutions, like the event stream architecture in OpenHands, are purpose-built to handle this complexity, whereas general frameworks offer more generic state models that are less suited to the domain.
Deep Environmental Integration: AI coding agents require a tight, low-level, and persistent connection to the developer's local environment, including the file system, version control systems like Git, command-line shells, and build tools. A custom framework enables this deep, native integration, treating the environment as a first-class component of the architecture rather than an external tool to be called through an abstraction layer.
Performance and Latency Sensitivity: The rapid feedback loop of the edit-lint-test-debug cycle is fundamental to developer productivity. Any performance overhead, whether in latency or memory consumption, can disrupt a developer's focus and flow state. General-purpose frameworks can introduce an unacceptable "framework tax," whereas bespoke solutions can be ruthlessly optimized for the minimal latency and resource footprint required for a seamless pair-programming experience.
Architectural Philosophy and Specialization: Leading agents embody a distinct architectural philosophy on how to solve coding problems. Aider's separation of reasoning and editing, OpenHands' focus on auditable event logs, and Devin's vertically integrated "compound AI system" are unique theses on agent design. These philosophies are best realized in a purpose-built framework that reflects their core principles, rather than being retrofitted into a generalist structure.
While custom frameworks dominate the landscape for generalist coding assistants, a notable trend is emerging: the use of general frameworks like LangGraph for more narrowly-scoped, auxiliary coding tasks, such as Uber's use case for automated unit test generation. This suggests a future characterized by a hybrid ecosystem, where bespoke agents handle open-ended, conversational programming, and framework-built agents automate specific, well-defined workflows within the development lifecycle.

Section 1: The Unique Demands of AI-Powered Software Engineering


Introduction: A New Mandate for Software Engineers

The software engineering landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation, shifting from an AI-augmented model, where tools assist developers, to an AI-native one, where AI is an integral part of the development lifecycle. Projections indicate that by 2028, a staggering 90% of enterprise software engineers will utilize AI code assistants in their daily work.1 This paradigm shift is redefining the role of the human developer, elevating them from a primary author of code to an "orchestrator of AI-driven workflows".1 In this new era, the demand is for AI tools that are not merely sophisticated auto-completers but are reliable, stateful, and collaborative partners. The central challenge for these tools, and the frameworks that underpin them, is no longer just about generating syntactically correct code, but about managing the complex, iterative, and often messy process of software creation from conception to deployment.

The Problem Space: Why Coding is a "Wicked Problem" for AI Agents

The task of software engineering presents a unique and formidable set of challenges for autonomous agents, distinguishing it from more straightforward tasks like question-answering or content summarization. These challenges directly inform the architectural requirements of any system designed to tackle them effectively.
Long-Running, Stateful Tasks: A typical software development request, such as "add a new feature" or "fix a bug in the authentication module," is not a single, atomic operation. It is a long-running task that involves a complex sequence of dependent actions: comprehending the existing codebase, formulating a multi-step plan, writing new code, modifying existing files, executing test suites, analyzing error messages, and iteratively debugging until the goal is achieved. This process requires a robust and persistent state management system that can recall context, track progress, and learn from mistakes across thousands of individual decisions.2
High-Fidelity Interaction with the Environment: Unlike many AI applications that operate on abstract data, a coding agent must interact directly and reliably with a developer's complex local environment. This is a non-negotiable requirement. The agent needs low-level, high-fidelity access to the local file system to read, write, and create files; a command-line shell to execute build scripts, linters, and test runners; the version control system (primarily Git) to track changes and understand project history; and often a web browser to research documentation or external APIs.2 The integrity of these interactions is paramount, as a single incorrect file modification or command execution can corrupt the codebase.
The Criticality of the Feedback Loop: The modern software development lifecycle is defined by its rapid and tight feedback loops, most notably the edit-compile-test-debug cycle. Developers rely on near-instantaneous feedback from linters, compilers, and test suites to validate their work and maintain momentum. Any latency or performance overhead introduced by an AI agent's framework disrupts this crucial process. Delays can break the developer's "flow state"—a state of deep, uninterrupted focus that is essential for high-quality, productive work.7 Therefore, the performance of the agent is not just a technical metric but a core component of its user experience and utility.
The "Vacuum Hypothesis" and Developer Burnout: The 2024 DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) report revealed a critical paradox in AI adoption. While AI tools can boost productivity in specific areas, they have also been correlated with a decrease in overall software delivery performance and have not meaningfully reduced developer burnout.7 The "Vacuum Hypothesis" suggests a potential reason: AI automates some of the more engaging and creative aspects of coding, leaving developers to fill their time with the lower-value, more tedious work of debugging and maintaining the AI-generated code. This underscores the need for a new class of agents that can handle the
entire workflow, including the "unpleasant" and repetitive parts like running tests and fixing the resulting errors. To be truly effective, an agent must be a reliable partner throughout the whole process, which demands a deeply integrated and highly reliable underlying architecture.7
The confluence of these factors—the need for long-term statefulness, deep environmental interaction, and minimal-latency feedback—means that the central challenge for an AI coding agent is not merely "reasoning" or "code generation." It is the far more complex problem of stateful execution in a complex, interactive environment. The architectural decisions made by the creators of leading agents are a direct and deliberate response to this fundamental challenge. Early AI coding tools focused on stateless code generation, but developers quickly found that the real bottleneck was not writing the initial code, but integrating, testing, and debugging it. The next generation of tools, such as Aider and Devin, understood that the true value lies in automating this entire iterative workflow. This automation is impossible without persistent state, fine-grained control over environmental actions, and deep access to the developer's tools. It is this realization that drives developers to build custom frameworks, as general-purpose solutions, designed for more abstract agentic loops, often lack the specific, high-performance primitives required for this specialized and demanding domain.

Section 2: The "Build" Paradigm: Architectural Deep-Dives of Custom Frameworks

An examination of the internal architectures of leading AI coding agents reveals that their custom frameworks are not merely ad-hoc collections of code. Instead, they are the physical manifestation of a specific, deeply-considered philosophy on how to solve the complex problem of automated software engineering. Each framework is purpose-built to support a unique approach to reasoning, state management, and environmental interaction.

2.1 Aider: The Git-Native, Command-Line Companion

Aider is conceived as an AI pair programmer that operates directly within the developer's terminal, treating the local Git repository as its primary workspace.4 Its architecture is fundamentally "Git-native," a design choice with profound implications for its workflow. Every set of changes proposed and accepted by the user is automatically committed to the repository with a descriptive message.6 This provides a natural and powerful safety net; developers can use familiar Git tools to review, diff, or revert the AI's work, seamlessly integrating the agent into established development practices.
Key Architectural Feature: The Architect/Editor Model
Aider's most significant and innovative architectural feature is its Architect/Editor model, a specialized two-step execution pipeline that separates the cognitive tasks of planning and editing.9 This design was motivated by the observation that different Large Language Models (LLMs) possess different strengths. Some models excel at high-level reasoning and planning but struggle to adhere to strict, structured output formats, while others are highly proficient at generating perfectly formatted code but may be less creative in their problem-solving.11
The pipeline works as follows:
The Architect model receives the user's high-level request (e.g., "Refactor this function to be more efficient"). Its sole responsibility is to reason about the problem and generate a plan, describing how to implement the solution in natural language or pseudo-code.11 It is not constrained by any specific output format.
The Editor model then receives the Architect's plan as input. Its task is purely mechanical: to translate the high-level plan into the precise, correctly formatted code edits (often using a diff format) that Aider requires to modify the local files.11
This separation of concerns allows Aider to leverage the best model for each sub-task—for instance, using a powerful but format-agnostic reasoning model like OpenAI's o1-preview as the Architect, and a reliable, format-compliant model like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the Editor. This hybrid approach has enabled Aider to achieve state-of-the-art results on challenging code editing benchmarks.10This dual-model pipeline represents a highly specialized execution loop. While it would be theoretically possible to implement such a flow in a general-purpose framework like LangGraph, it would likely be a cumbersome process, requiring the manual definition of custom nodes and complex logic for passing state between them. Aider's bespoke framework, in contrast, is built from the ground up to orchestrate this specific interaction, optimizing the data flow and control logic for its core architectural thesis.

2.2 OpenHands: The Event Stream Architecture for Auditable, Stateful Reasoning

OpenHands, which evolved from the OpenDevin project, is designed to be an open and extensible platform for AI software developers that can perform a wide range of tasks by mimicking how a human interacts with a computer environment.14
Key Architectural Feature: The Event Stream
The core of the OpenHands architecture is its event stream.18 This architecture acts as the system's backbone, capturing a chronological and immutable log of every event that occurs during a task's execution. An "event" is composed of an
action taken by the agent (e.g., CmdRunAction to run a shell command, IPythonRunCellAction to execute Python code) and the subsequent observation returned by the environment (e.g., the standard output of the command, a test failure message).18
This entire stream of action-observation pairs is preserved and serves as the complete historical context for the agent's next decision-making step. At each turn, the LLM is provided with this history, allowing it to reason based on a comprehensive and transparent record of its past attempts, successes, and failures.18 This design provides exceptional auditability and replayability, making it easier for developers to understand and debug the agent's behavior.
This architecture is fundamentally centered on state management. While a general framework like LangGraph also manages state, the OpenHands approach is explicitly log-centric, where the state is the history. Building this on a generic framework could be redundant or could clash with the framework's own, potentially more abstract, state management philosophy. The custom framework allows OpenHands to define precisely how events are structured, serialized, stored, and presented to the LLM. This control is crucial for managing the long and complex histories generated during software development tasks. However, this approach is not without its challenges; as the event stream grows, it can lead to very large context windows for the LLM, which in turn increases inference costs and latency.19

2.3 Devin: The "Compound AI System" and the Sandboxed Developer Environment

Devin, developed by Cognition AI, is positioned as the world's "first fully autonomous AI software engineer," a skilled teammate capable of independently handling complex, end-to-end engineering tasks from a single prompt.2 While its internal architecture is closed-source, its deployment model and public statements reveal a clear and deliberate design philosophy.
Key Architectural Features:
Integrated Sandboxed Environment: Devin operates within a comprehensive, sandboxed compute environment that is pre-equipped with all the tools a human developer would need: a command-line shell, a code editor, and a web browser.2 This provides the agent with maximum capability to perform real-world tasks while ensuring the user's host system remains secure and isolated.
Centralized "Brain" in the Cloud: A critical architectural detail is that even when Devin is deployed in a customer's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)—where the workspace and files reside on the client's infrastructure—the core reasoning and planning engine, referred to as Devin's "brain," always remains within Cognition's cloud.24 All interaction between the local workspace and the remote brain occurs over a secure WebSocket connection. This design allows Cognition to maintain control over its core intellectual property and continuously update the agent's intelligence for all users simultaneously.
"Compound AI System": Devin is described not as a simple agent but as a "compound AI system".24 The company explicitly states that it does not support the use of third-party LLM API keys. This strongly implies a proprietary, tightly integrated vertical stack where multiple specialized models, reasoning modules, and planning algorithms work in concert. This system is designed for advanced long-term reasoning, enabling Devin to plan and execute tasks requiring thousands of decisions and to learn from its mistakes through iterative feedback.2
Devin's architecture represents the ultimate "build" decision. It is a fully integrated, productized solution where the framework, models, and environment are inseparable. Attempting to construct such a system on a general-purpose, model-agnostic framework would be antithetical to its entire design philosophy, which is predicated on the performance and capability gains achievable only through tight vertical integration and control.
These three agents demonstrate that a custom framework is more than just a technical choice; it is an expression of an architectural thesis. Aider's Pipeline Specialization thesis posits that separating reasoning from editing is key to performance. OpenHands' Historical State Logging thesis argues that a transparent, immutable event log is the best way to manage state for complex tasks. And Devin's Vertically Integrated Intelligence thesis proposes that peak capability can only be achieved by controlling the entire stack, from the models to the execution environment. Each of these theses requires a bespoke framework to be fully realized.

Section 3: The "Buy" Paradigm: Evaluating General-Purpose Agentic Frameworks

While leading coding agents have opted to build their own foundations, a rich ecosystem of general-purpose agentic frameworks offers an alternative "buy" path. These frameworks provide pre-built components for orchestration, state management, and tool use, promising to accelerate development. However, an analysis of the most prominent options—LangGraph, Google ADK, and Agno—reveals architectural trade-offs and limitations that help explain why they have not been widely adopted for building generalist coding agents.

3.1 LangGraph: Power and Pitfalls of Low-Level Graph Orchestration

LangGraph emerged from the LangChain ecosystem as a more powerful and controllable solution for building complex, stateful agents.26 It is explicitly designed as a low-level library, avoiding the "hidden prompts" and "obfuscated cognitive architecture" of some higher-level tools, giving developers more direct control over the agent's logic.27
Key Features:
Stateful Graphs: The central abstraction is the StateGraph, where developers define a workflow as a set of nodes (processing steps, like a function or an LLM call) and edges (transitions between nodes). A state object is passed through the graph and explicitly updated at each node, providing a clear model for state management.26
Cyclical and Conditional Flows: LangGraph's primary advantage over simpler chaining libraries is its native support for cycles. This allows for true agent-like behavior, such as retrying a failed action, looping until a condition is met, or returning to a planning step after gathering new information.27
Human-in-the-Loop: The persistent nature of the state graph enables execution to be paused at any node, allowing a human to inspect the agent's state, provide feedback or approval, and then resume the workflow. This is a critical feature for building reliable and auditable systems.28
Cited Limitations for Specialized Tasks:
Setup Complexity: The power of LangGraph comes at the cost of a steeper learning curve. Developers must manually define the state schema, all nodes, and the conditional logic for all edges, a process that can be significantly more time-consuming than using higher-level abstractions.30
Performance and Cost Risks: The very flexibility that makes LangGraph powerful—its support for cycles—also introduces significant risks. If not managed with careful circuit-breaking logic, agents can become trapped in infinite loops, consuming vast amounts of computational resources and incurring high LLM token costs.31
Abstraction Trade-off: While LangGraph is low-level, it is still a framework with its own opinions and overhead. Developer commentary from community forums suggests a common pattern: teams may start with a framework like LangChain/LangGraph for rapid prototyping but find that for production environments, the framework adds "a fuck ton of baggage" and acts as a "black box" when things go wrong. This often leads them to gradually replace framework components with custom code to gain the ultimate level of control and performance.35

3.2 Google ADK: A Software Engineering Approach to Agent Development

Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source framework designed with the explicit goal of making agent development feel more like traditional software development. It provides a modular, flexible, and opinionated structure for creating and deploying agents, with a particular emphasis on multi-agent systems.36
Key Features:
Multi-Agent by Design: ADK's architecture excels at composing multiple specialized agents into collaborative systems. It provides clear abstractions for different workflow patterns, such as SequentialAgent (for linear pipelines), ParallelAgent, and hierarchical structures where a coordinator agent delegates tasks to sub-agents.38
Rich Tool Ecosystem: ADK is designed to be extensible, with built-in tools like Code Exec and compatibility with other ecosystems, including LangChain and CrewAI. It is heavily integrated with the Google Cloud ecosystem, providing connectors to services like Apigee and Vertex AI.38
Deployment-Ready: A core focus of ADK is the full development lifecycle, including containerization and deployment to various targets, most notably Google's fully managed Agent Engine runtime.38
Potential Limitations for Coding Agents:
Recency and Immaturity: ADK is a very new framework. Its first public PyPI release was in March 2025, with a v1.0.0 release in May 2025.43 As such, it lacks the years of battle-testing, community refinement, and extensive libraries that more established frameworks possess.
Generalist, Business-Logic Focus: While ADK includes a Code Exec tool, its entire design ethos and the majority of its examples are centered on orchestrating multiple generalist or specialized business agents. Examples often feature a "greeter agent" delegating to a "task executor agent" or a "weather agent".39 The framework is not explicitly optimized for the unique, file-system-intensive, and deeply iterative needs of a single, highly complex coding agent.
Potential for Abstraction Overhead: Like any general framework, ADK introduces its own set of abstractions (LlmAgent, WorkflowAgent, etc.). For the specific domain of coding, these abstractions may not map cleanly to the required tasks, potentially adding a layer of complexity without providing a commensurate benefit compared to a more direct, custom implementation.

3.3 Agno: The Lightweight, High-Performance Alternative

Agno positions itself as a "clean, composable, and Pythonic" framework, designed to be an antidote to the "messy, brittle, and hard to maintain" approach of stitching together disparate wrappers and glue code.47 Its primary value proposition is its extreme focus on performance—specifically, low-latency instantiation and a minimal memory footprint—and a simple, declarative API.48
Key Features:
Performance-Obsessed: The documentation prominently features performance benchmarks, claiming agent instantiation times of ~3 microseconds and average memory usage of ~6.5 kilobytes.48 This is a direct response to the performance bottlenecks and resource demands that are common criticisms of heavier, more complex frameworks.50
Declarative and Model-Agnostic: Agents are configured using a simple, declarative Python interface. The framework is model-agnostic, providing a unified API for over 23 model providers, which helps developers avoid vendor lock-in.47
First-Class Tools and Reasoning: Agno includes built-in tools for common tasks, including Code evaluation, and supports multiple strategies for implementing agentic reasoning. It also provides native support for memory, knowledge retrieval, and multi-agent teams.47
Potential Limitations for Coding Agents:
Simplicity vs. Complexity Mismatch: Agno's strength is its simplicity. However, building a state-of-the-art coding agent capable of solving complex problems in large codebases is an inherently complex task. It is unclear whether Agno's streamlined abstractions are powerful enough to manage the deep, nested state and complex conditional logic required for such tasks without devolving into the very "messy glue code" it aims to replace.
Maturity and Ecosystem: Agno is a newer player in the agent framework space (having rebranded from Phidata). While it is gaining traction, its ecosystem, community support, and collection of third-party integrations may be less extensive than those of the LangChain/LangGraph ecosystem.51 Its features for long-term durability and complex state management are less battle-tested in production for the kind of grueling, multi-hour debugging sessions that a coding agent must endure.
Ultimately, a developer attempting to build a generalist coding agent would encounter a different set of frustrations with each of these frameworks. With LangGraph, they would appreciate the control but might struggle with the complexity and performance implications of passing large file contents through the state graph. With ADK, they would find a familiar software engineering paradigm but might feel the abstractions are better suited for inter-agent communication than the tight, intra-agent refinement loop that coding requires. With Agno, they would be drawn to the impressive performance claims but might question whether its simple, declarative structure is robust enough for the sheer complexity of the task. This journey often leads to the same conclusion: the effort required to bend a general-purpose framework to the specific, demanding will of a coding agent is often greater than the effort to build a lightweight, bespoke solution that does exactly what is needed—and nothing more.

Section 4: The Chasm of Specificity: A Comparative Analysis

The decision to build a custom framework for an AI coding agent is rooted in a fundamental mismatch between the generic abstractions provided by "buy" solutions and the highly specific requirements of the software engineering domain. This chasm is most evident when analyzing three key areas: execution control, state management, and environmental integration.

4.1 Technical Justification: Control, State, and Environment

Fine-Grained Execution Loop Control: Custom frameworks provide developers with complete, unobscured control over the agent's internal logic. Aider's Architect/Editor model is a prime example of a specialized execution loop designed to optimize for a specific problem: the differing capabilities of LLMs in reasoning versus formatted output. This bespoke pipeline allows Aider to control precisely how many LLM calls are made for a single user request, what specific context is passed to each model, and how their outputs are merged to produce the final code edit. General-purpose frameworks, by contrast, often present the agent's reasoning loop as a more monolithic or abstracted process (e.g., a single "agent" node in a graph), making such fine-tuned, multi-step reasoning more complex to implement.11
Specialized State Management: A coding task requires tracking a multifaceted and dynamic state that includes the content of multiple files, the results of test runs, linting errors, the history of failed attempts, and the agent's own evolving plan. Custom frameworks can build state management systems tailored to these specific entities. OpenHands' Event Stream is a purpose-built architecture for this, creating a perfect, auditable log of every action and observation, which is ideal for long-term reasoning and debugging.18 While general frameworks like LangGraph offer robust state management via its
StateGraph, the state is typically a generic key-value store or a list of messages. It is not inherently structured to understand the relationships between files, tests, and errors in a software project.
Tight Integration with Local Environment: For a coding agent, the local development environment is not just a source of data; it is the canvas on which it works. Aider's deep, native integration with git is a core feature, not an optional tool.4 This allows it to leverage git's powerful diffing, versioning, and rollback capabilities as a fundamental part of its operation. Building this level of seamless, low-level integration on top of a general framework, which typically treats environmental interactions as discrete, black-box "tool calls," would be less efficient and would sacrifice the tight coupling that makes the user experience fluid and intuitive.

4.2 Performance and Control: The Latency Tax

General-purpose frameworks, by their nature, introduce layers of abstraction to achieve their flexibility and broad applicability. Each of these layers, however, can impose a "framework tax" in the form of added latency and memory consumption.50 For many applications, this overhead is negligible. But for an AI coding agent, where a developer expects near-instantaneous feedback in the rapid-fire edit-lint-test loop, even small delays are disruptive.
The marketing and design of the Agno framework are built almost entirely on addressing this pain point, positioning it as a high-performance alternative to heavier frameworks and implicitly acknowledging that performance is a major concern for agent developers.48 Furthermore, developer discussions frequently highlight that while frameworks are excellent for prototyping, their "baggage" and "black box" nature can become a significant liability in performance-critical production environments.35 A custom-built framework can be ruthlessly optimized for its specific task, stripping out any unnecessary overhead to ensure the lowest possible latency in the critical developer feedback loop.

4.3 A List of Limitations: Architectural Mismatches in General Frameworks

When viewed through the lens of building a generalist coding agent, the architectural choices of general frameworks reveal several key limitations.
LangGraph:
Inefficient State Handling for Large Files: LangGraph's model involves passing the entire state object between nodes. When the state includes the contents of multiple large source code files, this can become highly inefficient in terms of memory and serialization overhead. A custom framework can work with file paths and only read/write from disk when absolutely necessary, keeping the in-memory state lean.
Risk of Uncontrolled Loops: The cyclical nature of LangGraph is a powerful feature, but it also presents a significant risk. A bug-fixing loop could get stuck repeating the same failed attempt. A custom framework can implement more domain-specific circuit breakers, such as, "If the same test suite fails three consecutive times with a similar stack trace, halt execution and ask the user for guidance".31
Generic Tool Abstraction: LangGraph's ToolNode is a generic wrapper for function calls. A custom framework can implement more specialized and intelligent action types, such as RunTests, ApplyDiff, or RunLinter, with built-in logic for parsing the specific output formats and error codes of these common development tools.
Google ADK:
Agent-Centric, Not File-Centric Abstractions: ADK's architecture is fundamentally designed for orchestrating communication and delegation between agents. The primary task of a coding agent, however, is orchestrating edits across files. The framework's core abstractions may not align well with this file-centric workflow.
Over-Emphasis on Multi-Agent Collaboration: The framework's main strengths lie in defining how multiple agents collaborate to solve a problem.38 This is often overkill for a single, powerful coding agent, and the abstractions designed for multi-agent systems may introduce unnecessary complexity.
Immaturity and Lack of Battle-Testing: As a very new framework, ADK lacks the years of community use and refinement needed to handle the vast number of edge cases and environmental quirks inherent in software development across different operating systems, languages, and project configurations.44
Agno:
Simplicity at the Cost of Depth: Agno's design prioritizes a clean, simple, and declarative interface, which is excellent for many use cases.47 However, state-of-the-art coding agents are inherently complex systems. It remains an open question whether Agno's abstractions are powerful enough to manage the deep, nested state and complex conditional logic of a long-running debugging session without requiring the developer to write the same kind of "messy glue code" the framework aims to eliminate.
Unproven Reliability for Enterprise-Scale Coding: Agno's benchmarks focus on instantiation speed and memory footprint.48 For a coding agent intended for professional use, features like rock-solid reliability, predictable behavior, and robust error handling are often more critical than raw startup speed. The framework's maturity in these "boring" but essential enterprise-grade features is less proven than that of custom solutions designed from day one to solve these problems.
The following table provides a comparative summary of how custom-built frameworks and general-purpose frameworks address the core requirements of an AI coding agent.

Requirement
Custom Frameworks (Aider, OpenHands, Devin)
General-Purpose Frameworks (LangGraph, ADK, Agno)
Filesystem & Git Integration
Native, deep, and treated as a core architectural component. Git is often used for state and versioning.
Handled via abstracted tool calls. Lacks the tight, seamless coupling of a native approach.
State Management
Bespoke and domain-specific (e.g., Event Stream, git history). Optimized for tracking files, tests, and errors.
Generic state models (e.g., key-value objects, message lists). Not inherently aware of software development entities.
Execution Loop Control
Fine-grained, with full control over the internal logic, including multi-step LLM pipelines (e.g., Architect/Editor).
Abstracted into nodes and edges. Provides control over the flow but less over the internal mechanics of each step.
Performance Profile
Optimized for low latency and minimal resource footprint to support rapid developer feedback loops.
Prone to "framework tax" (latency/memory overhead) due to layers of abstraction. Performance is a common concern.
Extensibility
Infinitely flexible, as any new logic can be coded directly. The only limit is developer effort.
Pluggable and modular, but extensions are constrained by the framework's core design and abstractions.
Ease of Prototyping
Higher initial development effort, as foundational components must be built from scratch.
Lower initial effort, as frameworks provide pre-built components for state, tools, and orchestration.


Section 5: Bridging the Gap: Counter-Examples and Hybrid Strategies

While the landscape of general-purpose, conversational coding agents is dominated by custom-built frameworks, this does not signify that general frameworks have no role to play in the broader domain of AI-powered software engineering. An analysis of notable counter-examples reveals a distinct and important pattern: general-purpose frameworks like LangGraph are being successfully adopted for well-defined, auxiliary, and workflow-driven tasks within a larger development ecosystem.

Case Study 1: Uber's "AutoCover" for Unit Test Generation

Uber's Developer Platform team has developed a tool called "AutoCover" to automate the generation of unit tests, a critical task for maintaining code quality during large-scale code migrations. This system is built using LangGraph.29
Architecture and Implementation: Uber's approach is highly sophisticated. They have constructed an opinionated internal framework called "Lang Effect," which wraps LangGraph and LangChain to integrate more smoothly with Uber's extensive internal infrastructure and build systems.54 The AutoCover system itself is a network of specialized agents orchestrated by LangGraph. This includes a "scaffolder agent" to prepare the test environment, a "generator agent" to create test cases, and an "executor agent" to run the tests and analyze coverage.54
Why LangGraph is a Good Fit: The task of "generating a unit test for a given function" is far more constrained than an open-ended request like "fix this bug." It has a clear input (a specific piece of code) and a clear, automatable success condition (the generated test compiles, runs, and increases code coverage). This type of well-defined, stateful workflow is an excellent match for LangGraph's graph-based orchestration model. The process can be modeled as a state machine: analyze code, generate test, execute test, check result, and loop if necessary. This is precisely the kind of complex but structured workflow that LangGraph is designed to handle. It is important to note, however, that this is an internal tool and is not open-source.54

Case Study 2: Replit's AI Agent for Code Generation

Replit, the popular browser-based IDE, utilizes LangGraph to power its AI code generation agent.29
Architecture and Implementation: The Replit team emphasizes a multi-agent setup that heavily incorporates human-in-the-loop capabilities. LangGraph's first-class support for streaming allows Replit to provide users with real-time visibility into the agent's actions, such as installing packages or creating files within the IDE's virtual environment.29
Why LangGraph is a Good Fit: In this case, the agent is operating within the controlled and well-defined context of the Replit IDE. Its scope of action is limited to the user's project environment. LangGraph's core strengths—robust state management for tracking the coding session, human-in-the-loop for user interaction and approval, and streaming for a transparent user experience—are ideal for this application. It is another example of using a general framework to power a specific, complex feature within a larger product, rather than as the basis for a standalone, generalist coding assistant.

Other Notable Implementations

The pattern of using LangGraph for structured, data-centric tasks extends beyond direct code generation. Elastic uses LangGraph to orchestrate AI agents for security threat detection, a workflow that involves analyzing data and identifying patterns.53
LinkedIn built an internal SQL-generating bot on LangGraph to help employees query databases using natural language.29 These examples reinforce the conclusion that LangGraph's sweet spot is the automation of complex but repeatable, stateful workflows.
The "build vs. buy" decision is therefore highly dependent on the specific task. The evidence suggests a clear divergence. For open-ended, conversational, general-purpose coding agents that must act as versatile pair-programming partners, the fine-grained control and optimized performance of a custom-built framework are currently preferred. For more structured, automatable, and repeatable sub-problems within the software development lifecycle (like test generation, documentation updates, or SQL querying), the powerful orchestration and state management capabilities of a general framework like LangGraph provide an ideal and efficient solution.
This points not to a future where one approach wins, but to a hybrid ecosystem. Engineering organizations will likely employ both types of tools: a primary, conversational coding agent (built on a custom framework) for interactive, creative, and debugging tasks, while simultaneously deploying fleets of specialized, workflow-based agents (built on general frameworks) to their CI/CD pipelines and other automated systems to handle rote tasks.

Section 6: Historical Context and Future Trajectories

The current prevalence of custom frameworks among top-tier AI coding agents is not solely a result of technical and philosophical choices; it is also a product of historical timing. The evolution of these agents has, until recently, outpaced the maturity of general-purpose agentic frameworks, making the "build" decision as much a matter of necessity as of preference.

6.1 The Timeline of Innovation: A Race Between Agents and Frameworks

An analysis of the release dates and development timelines of key agents and frameworks reveals a clear pattern: the foundational work on today's leading custom-built agents began when the general-purpose alternatives were either non-existent or significantly less mature.

Framework
The rebranded framework (formerly Phidata) is actively discussed and integrated into other tools.

Note: The development of Aider was ongoing during this period, with its PyPI history showing rapid, continuous releases starting around August 2024, indicating its core architecture was likely established before the maturation of frameworks like ADK and the more controllable version of LangGraph.65
This timeline demonstrates that the core architectural decisions for agents like Devin and Aider were made at a time when a mature, off-the-shelf framework capable of meeting their complex needs simply did not exist. LangGraph was new and evolving, and Google ADK had not yet been released. Building a custom framework was the only viable path to achieving their ambitious goals. The emergence of OpenHands with its own bespoke architecture, even after LangGraph was more established, further suggests that its developers felt a custom approach was better suited to their specific vision of an auditable, event-driven system.

6.2 Future Trajectories: Convergence, Specialization, or Hybridization?

The key question now is whether this trend will continue. As general-purpose frameworks like LangGraph, ADK, and Agno mature and add more features, will new coding agents be built on top of them? The answer is likely nuanced.
The "Build" Imperative for Generalists May Remain: For flagship, general-purpose coding agents that aim to be versatile, conversational partners, the arguments for a custom build—fine-grained control, optimized performance, and the implementation of a unique architectural philosophy—will likely remain compelling. It is difficult for a general framework to provide the same level of domain-specific optimization as a bespoke solution.
The Rise of the Hybrid Ecosystem: The most probable future is not a "winner-take-all" scenario but a hybrid model. This ecosystem will likely consist of:
Generalist, Conversational Agents (Custom-Built): Developers will use these for interactive, open-ended tasks like pair programming, debugging complex issues, and architectural exploration.
Specialist, Workflow Agents (Framework-Built): These agents will be integrated into automated systems like CI/CD pipelines to handle specific, repeatable tasks such as generating unit tests, updating dependencies, writing documentation from code, or performing security scans.
Frameworks Will Continue to Evolve: The general-purpose frameworks are not static targets. LangGraph is actively adding features like node caching and pre/post model hooks to improve performance and control.66 Google ADK is rapidly building out its tool ecosystem and enterprise deployment options.38 Agno continues to push the boundaries of performance and simplicity.48 As these frameworks become more powerful and flexible, the barrier to using them for more complex, coding-related tasks will lower, likely accelerating the adoption of specialist, workflow-driven agents.
The "build vs. buy" decision for AI coding agents, which began as a matter of necessity, has now evolved into a strategic choice dictated by the agent's intended scope. The historical trend of building custom frameworks for generalist agents will likely continue, but it will be complemented by a new and growing trend of using powerful general-purpose frameworks to build an army of specialized agents that automate the toil of the software development lifecycle. The question for engineering leaders is no longer a single "build or buy," but a more sophisticated portfolio question: "Which tasks are best suited for 'build,' and which are best suited for 'buy'?"

Executive Summary

The rapid proliferation of AI coding agents has introduced a significant architectural schism: while a mature ecosystem of general-purpose agentic frameworks like LangGraph, Google ADK, and Agno exists, the most prominent and performant coding agents—such as Aider, OpenHands, and the influential Devin—are predominantly built on bespoke, custom frameworks. This report provides an exhaustive investigation into this phenomenon, concluding that the decision to build rather than buy is not a manifestation of "Not-Invented-Here" syndrome but a calculated engineering necessity. It is driven by the unique, high-fidelity demands of the software development domain, which current general-purpose frameworks are not architected to meet with the required precision and performance.
The analysis identifies five principal reasons compelling the development of custom frameworks for AI coding agents:
Fine-Grained Execution Control: The iterative and often unpredictable nature of coding requires absolute control over the agent's internal execution loop, including nuanced error handling, context management, and multi-step tool interactions. Custom frameworks allow developers to design specialized pipelines, such as Aider's Architect/Editor model, that are optimized for coding tasks, a level of control often obscured by the higher-level abstractions of general frameworks.
Specialized State Management for Iterative Development: Software development is a long-running, non-linear process of refinement, testing, and debugging. This necessitates a sophisticated state management model capable of tracking file versions, test outcomes, error logs, and an evolving strategic plan across thousands of steps. Custom solutions, like the event stream architecture in OpenHands, are purpose-built to handle this complexity, whereas general frameworks offer more generic state models that are less suited to the domain.
Deep Environmental Integration: AI coding agents require a tight, low-level, and persistent connection to the developer's local environment, including the file system, version control systems like Git, command-line shells, and build tools. A custom framework enables this deep, native integration, treating the environment as a first-class component of the architecture rather than an external tool to be called through an abstraction layer.
Performance and Latency Sensitivity: The rapid feedback loop of the edit-lint-test-debug cycle is fundamental to developer productivity. Any performance overhead, whether in latency or memory consumption, can disrupt a developer's focus and flow state. General-purpose frameworks can introduce an unacceptable "framework tax," whereas bespoke solutions can be ruthlessly optimized for the minimal latency and resource footprint required for a seamless pair-programming experience.
Architectural Philosophy and Specialization: Leading agents embody a distinct architectural philosophy on how to solve coding problems. Aider's separation of reasoning and editing, OpenHands' focus on auditable event logs, and Devin's vertically integrated "compound AI system" are unique theses on agent design. These philosophies are best realized in a purpose-built framework that reflects their core principles, rather than being retrofitted into a generalist structure.
While custom frameworks dominate the landscape for generalist coding assistants, a notable trend is emerging: the use of general frameworks like LangGraph for more narrowly-scoped, auxiliary coding tasks, such as Uber's use case for automated unit test generation. This suggests a future characterized by a hybrid ecosystem, where bespoke agents handle open-ended, conversational programming, and framework-built agents automate specific, well-defined workflows within the development lifecycle.

Section 1: The Unique Demands of AI-Powered Software Engineering


Introduction: A New Mandate for Software Engineers

The software engineering landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation, shifting from an AI-augmented model, where tools assist developers, to an AI-native one, where AI is an integral part of the development lifecycle. Projections indicate that by 2028, a staggering 90% of enterprise software engineers will utilize AI code assistants in their daily work.1 This paradigm shift is redefining the role of the human developer, elevating them from a primary author of code to an "orchestrator of AI-driven workflows".1 In this new era, the demand is for AI tools that are not merely sophisticated auto-completers but are reliable, stateful, and collaborative partners. The central challenge for these tools, and the frameworks that underpin them, is no longer just about generating syntactically correct code, but about managing the complex, iterative, and often messy process of software creation from conception to deployment.

The Problem Space: Why Coding is a "Wicked Problem" for AI Agents

The task of software engineering presents a unique and formidable set of challenges for autonomous agents, distinguishing it from more straightforward tasks like question-answering or content summarization. These challenges directly inform the architectural requirements of any system designed to tackle them effectively.
Long-Running, Stateful Tasks: A typical software development request, such as "add a new feature" or "fix a bug in the authentication module," is not a single, atomic operation. It is a long-running task that involves a complex sequence of dependent actions: comprehending the existing codebase, formulating a multi-step plan, writing new code, modifying existing files, executing test suites, analyzing error messages, and iteratively debugging until the goal is achieved. This process requires a robust and persistent state management system that can recall context, track progress, and learn from mistakes across thousands of individual decisions.2
High-Fidelity Interaction with the Environment: Unlike many AI applications that operate on abstract data, a coding agent must interact directly and reliably with a developer's complex local environment. This is a non-negotiable requirement. The agent needs low-level, high-fidelity access to the local file system to read, write, and create files; a command-line shell to execute build scripts, linters, and test runners; the version control system (primarily Git) to track changes and understand project history; and often a web browser to research documentation or external APIs.2 The integrity of these interactions is paramount, as a single incorrect file modification or command execution can corrupt the codebase.
The Criticality of the Feedback Loop: The modern software development lifecycle is defined by its rapid and tight feedback loops, most notably the edit-compile-test-debug cycle. Developers rely on near-instantaneous feedback from linters, compilers, and test suites to validate their work and maintain momentum. Any latency or performance overhead introduced by an AI agent's framework disrupts this crucial process. Delays can break the developer's "flow state"—a state of deep, uninterrupted focus that is essential for high-quality, productive work.7 Therefore, the performance of the agent is not just a technical metric but a core component of its user experience and utility.
The "Vacuum Hypothesis" and Developer Burnout: The 2024 DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) report revealed a critical paradox in AI adoption. While AI tools can boost productivity in specific areas, they have also been correlated with a decrease in overall software delivery performance and have not meaningfully reduced developer burnout.7 The "Vacuum Hypothesis" suggests a potential reason: AI automates some of the more engaging and creative aspects of coding, leaving developers to fill their time with the lower-value, more tedious work of debugging and maintaining the AI-generated code. This underscores the need for a new class of agents that can handle the
entire workflow, including the "unpleasant" and repetitive parts like running tests and fixing the resulting errors. To be truly effective, an agent must be a reliable partner throughout the whole process, which demands a deeply integrated and highly reliable underlying architecture.7
The confluence of these factors—the need for long-term statefulness, deep environmental interaction, and minimal-latency feedback—means that the central challenge for an AI coding agent is not merely "reasoning" or "code generation." It is the far more complex problem of stateful execution in a complex, interactive environment. The architectural decisions made by the creators of leading agents are a direct and deliberate response to this fundamental challenge. Early AI coding tools focused on stateless code generation, but developers quickly found that the real bottleneck was not writing the initial code, but integrating, testing, and debugging it. The next generation of tools, such as Aider and Devin, understood that the true value lies in automating this entire iterative workflow. This automation is impossible without persistent state, fine-grained control over environmental actions, and deep access to the developer's tools. It is this realization that drives developers to build custom frameworks, as general-purpose solutions, designed for more abstract agentic loops, often lack the specific, high-performance primitives required for this specialized and demanding domain.

Section 2: The "Build" Paradigm: Architectural Deep-Dives of Custom Frameworks

An examination of the internal architectures of leading AI coding agents reveals that their custom frameworks are not merely ad-hoc collections of code. Instead, they are the physical manifestation of a specific, deeply-considered philosophy on how to solve the complex problem of automated software engineering. Each framework is purpose-built to support a unique approach to reasoning, state management, and environmental interaction.

2.1 Aider: The Git-Native, Command-Line Companion

Aider is conceived as an AI pair programmer that operates directly within the developer's terminal, treating the local Git repository as its primary workspace.4 Its architecture is fundamentally "Git-native," a design choice with profound implications for its workflow. Every set of changes proposed and accepted by the user is automatically committed to the repository with a descriptive message.6 This provides a natural and powerful safety net; developers can use familiar Git tools to review, diff, or revert the AI's work, seamlessly integrating the agent into established development practices.
Key Architectural Feature: The Architect/Editor Model
Aider's most significant and innovative architectural feature is its Architect/Editor model, a specialized two-step execution pipeline that separates the cognitive tasks of planning and editing.9 This design was motivated by the observation that different Large Language Models (LLMs) possess different strengths. Some models excel at high-level reasoning and planning but struggle to adhere to strict, structured output formats, while others are highly proficient at generating perfectly formatted code but may be less creative in their problem-solving.11
The pipeline works as follows:
The Architect model receives the user's high-level request (e.g., "Refactor this function to be more efficient"). Its sole responsibility is to reason about the problem and generate a plan, describing how to implement the solution in natural language or pseudo-code.11 It is not constrained by any specific output format.
The Editor model then receives the Architect's plan as input. Its task is purely mechanical: to translate the high-level plan into the precise, correctly formatted code edits (often using a diff format) that Aider requires to modify the local files.11
This separation of concerns allows Aider to leverage the best model for each sub-task—for instance, using a powerful but format-agnostic reasoning model like OpenAI's o1-preview as the Architect, and a reliable, format-compliant model like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the Editor. This hybrid approach has enabled Aider to achieve state-of-the-art results on challenging code editing benchmarks.10This dual-model pipeline represents a highly specialized execution loop. While it would be theoretically possible to implement such a flow in a general-purpose framework like LangGraph, it would likely be a cumbersome process, requiring the manual definition of custom nodes and complex logic for passing state between them. Aider's bespoke framework, in contrast, is built from the ground up to orchestrate this specific interaction, optimizing the data flow and control logic for its core architectural thesis.

2.2 OpenHands: The Event Stream Architecture for Auditable, Stateful Reasoning

OpenHands, which evolved from the OpenDevin project, is designed to be an open and extensible platform for AI software developers that can perform a wide range of tasks by mimicking how a human interacts with a computer environment.14
Key Architectural Feature: The Event Stream
The core of the OpenHands architecture is its event stream.18 This architecture acts as the system's backbone, capturing a chronological and immutable log of every event that occurs during a task's execution. An "event" is composed of an
action taken by the agent (e.g., CmdRunAction to run a shell command, IPythonRunCellAction to execute Python code) and the subsequent observation returned by the environment (e.g., the standard output of the command, a test failure message).18
This entire stream of action-observation pairs is preserved and serves as the complete historical context for the agent's next decision-making step. At each turn, the LLM is provided with this history, allowing it to reason based on a comprehensive and transparent record of its past attempts, successes, and failures.18 This design provides exceptional auditability and replayability, making it easier for developers to understand and debug the agent's behavior.
This architecture is fundamentally centered on state management. While a general framework like LangGraph also manages state, the OpenHands approach is explicitly log-centric, where the state is the history. Building this on a generic framework could be redundant or could clash with the framework's own, potentially more abstract, state management philosophy. The custom framework allows OpenHands to define precisely how events are structured, serialized, stored, and presented to the LLM. This control is crucial for managing the long and complex histories generated during software development tasks. However, this approach is not without its challenges; as the event stream grows, it can lead to very large context windows for the LLM, which in turn increases inference costs and latency.19

2.3 Devin: The "Compound AI System" and the Sandboxed Developer Environment

Devin, developed by Cognition AI, is positioned as the world's "first fully autonomous AI software engineer," a skilled teammate capable of independently handling complex, end-to-end engineering tasks from a single prompt.2 While its internal architecture is closed-source, its deployment model and public statements reveal a clear and deliberate design philosophy.
Key Architectural Features:
Integrated Sandboxed Environment: Devin operates within a comprehensive, sandboxed compute environment that is pre-equipped with all the tools a human developer would need: a command-line shell, a code editor, and a web browser.2 This provides the agent with maximum capability to perform real-world tasks while ensuring the user's host system remains secure and isolated.
Centralized "Brain" in the Cloud: A critical architectural detail is that even when Devin is deployed in a customer's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)—where the workspace and files reside on the client's infrastructure—the core reasoning and planning engine, referred to as Devin's "brain," always remains within Cognition's cloud.24 All interaction between the local workspace and the remote brain occurs over a secure WebSocket connection. This design allows Cognition to maintain control over its core intellectual property and continuously update the agent's intelligence for all users simultaneously.
"Compound AI System": Devin is described not as a simple agent but as a "compound AI system".24 The company explicitly states that it does not support the use of third-party LLM API keys. This strongly implies a proprietary, tightly integrated vertical stack where multiple specialized models, reasoning modules, and planning algorithms work in concert. This system is designed for advanced long-term reasoning, enabling Devin to plan and execute tasks requiring thousands of decisions and to learn from its mistakes through iterative feedback.2
Devin's architecture represents the ultimate "build" decision. It is a fully integrated, productized solution where the framework, models, and environment are inseparable. Attempting to construct such a system on a general-purpose, model-agnostic framework would be antithetical to its entire design philosophy, which is predicated on the performance and capability gains achievable only through tight vertical integration and control.
These three agents demonstrate that a custom framework is more than just a technical choice; it is an expression of an architectural thesis. Aider's Pipeline Specialization thesis posits that separating reasoning from editing is key to performance. OpenHands' Historical State Logging thesis argues that a transparent, immutable event log is the best way to manage state for complex tasks. And Devin's Vertically Integrated Intelligence thesis proposes that peak capability can only be achieved by controlling the entire stack, from the models to the execution environment. Each of these theses requires a bespoke framework to be fully realized.

Section 3: The "Buy" Paradigm: Evaluating General-Purpose Agentic Frameworks

While leading coding agents have opted to build their own foundations, a rich ecosystem of general-purpose agentic frameworks offers an alternative "buy" path. These frameworks provide pre-built components for orchestration, state management, and tool use, promising to accelerate development. However, an analysis of the most prominent options—LangGraph, Google ADK, and Agno—reveals architectural trade-offs and limitations that help explain why they have not been widely adopted for building generalist coding agents.

3.1 LangGraph: Power and Pitfalls of Low-Level Graph Orchestration

LangGraph emerged from the LangChain ecosystem as a more powerful and controllable solution for building complex, stateful agents.26 It is explicitly designed as a low-level library, avoiding the "hidden prompts" and "obfuscated cognitive architecture" of some higher-level tools, giving developers more direct control over the agent's logic.27
Key Features:
Stateful Graphs: The central abstraction is the StateGraph, where developers define a workflow as a set of nodes (processing steps, like a function or an LLM call) and edges (transitions between nodes). A state object is passed through the graph and explicitly updated at each node, providing a clear model for state management.26
Cyclical and Conditional Flows: LangGraph's primary advantage over simpler chaining libraries is its native support for cycles. This allows for true agent-like behavior, such as retrying a failed action, looping until a condition is met, or returning to a planning step after gathering new information.27
Human-in-the-Loop: The persistent nature of the state graph enables execution to be paused at any node, allowing a human to inspect the agent's state, provide feedback or approval, and then resume the workflow. This is a critical feature for building reliable and auditable systems.28
Cited Limitations for Specialized Tasks:
Setup Complexity: The power of LangGraph comes at the cost of a steeper learning curve. Developers must manually define the state schema, all nodes, and the conditional logic for all edges, a process that can be significantly more time-consuming than using higher-level abstractions.30
Performance and Cost Risks: The very flexibility that makes LangGraph powerful—its support for cycles—also introduces significant risks. If not managed with careful circuit-breaking logic, agents can become trapped in infinite loops, consuming vast amounts of computational resources and incurring high LLM token costs.31
Abstraction Trade-off: While LangGraph is low-level, it is still a framework with its own opinions and overhead. Developer commentary from community forums suggests a common pattern: teams may start with a framework like LangChain/LangGraph for rapid prototyping but find that for production environments, the framework adds "a fuck ton of baggage" and acts as a "black box" when things go wrong. This often leads them to gradually replace framework components with custom code to gain the ultimate level of control and performance.35

3.2 Google ADK: A Software Engineering Approach to Agent Development

Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source framework designed with the explicit goal of making agent development feel more like traditional software development. It provides a modular, flexible, and opinionated structure for creating and deploying agents, with a particular emphasis on multi-agent systems.36
Key Features:
Multi-Agent by Design: ADK's architecture excels at composing multiple specialized agents into collaborative systems. It provides clear abstractions for different workflow patterns, such as SequentialAgent (for linear pipelines), ParallelAgent, and hierarchical structures where a coordinator agent delegates tasks to sub-agents.38
Rich Tool Ecosystem: ADK is designed to be extensible, with built-in tools like Code Exec and compatibility with other ecosystems, including LangChain and CrewAI. It is heavily integrated with the Google Cloud ecosystem, providing connectors to services like Apigee and Vertex AI.38
Deployment-Ready: A core focus of ADK is the full development lifecycle, including containerization and deployment to various targets, most notably Google's fully managed Agent Engine runtime.38
Potential Limitations for Coding Agents:
Recency and Immaturity: ADK is a very new framework. Its first public PyPI release was in March 2025, with a v1.0.0 release in May 2025.43 As such, it lacks the years of battle-testing, community refinement, and extensive libraries that more established frameworks possess.
Generalist, Business-Logic Focus: While ADK includes a Code Exec tool, its entire design ethos and the majority of its examples are centered on orchestrating multiple generalist or specialized business agents. Examples often feature a "greeter agent" delegating to a "task executor agent" or a "weather agent".39 The framework is not explicitly optimized for the unique, file-system-intensive, and deeply iterative needs of a single, highly complex coding agent.
Potential for Abstraction Overhead: Like any general framework, ADK introduces its own set of abstractions (LlmAgent, WorkflowAgent, etc.). For the specific domain of coding, these abstractions may not map cleanly to the required tasks, potentially adding a layer of complexity without providing a commensurate benefit compared to a more direct, custom implementation.

3.3 Agno: The Lightweight, High-Performance Alternative

Agno positions itself as a "clean, composable, and Pythonic" framework, designed to be an antidote to the "messy, brittle, and hard to maintain" approach of stitching together disparate wrappers and glue code.47 Its primary value proposition is its extreme focus on performance—specifically, low-latency instantiation and a minimal memory footprint—and a simple, declarative API.48
Key Features:
Performance-Obsessed: The documentation prominently features performance benchmarks, claiming agent instantiation times of ~3 microseconds and average memory usage of ~6.5 kilobytes.48 This is a direct response to the performance bottlenecks and resource demands that are common criticisms of heavier, more complex frameworks.50
Declarative and Model-Agnostic: Agents are configured using a simple, declarative Python interface. The framework is model-agnostic, providing a unified API for over 23 model providers, which helps developers avoid vendor lock-in.47
First-Class Tools and Reasoning: Agno includes built-in tools for common tasks, including Code evaluation, and supports multiple strategies for implementing agentic reasoning. It also provides native support for memory, knowledge retrieval, and multi-agent teams.47
Potential Limitations for Coding Agents:
Simplicity vs. Complexity Mismatch: Agno's strength is its simplicity. However, building a state-of-the-art coding agent capable of solving complex problems in large codebases is an inherently complex task. It is unclear whether Agno's streamlined abstractions are powerful enough to manage the deep, nested state and complex conditional logic required for such tasks without devolving into the very "messy glue code" it aims to replace.
Maturity and Ecosystem: Agno is a newer player in the agent framework space (having rebranded from Phidata). While it is gaining traction, its ecosystem, community support, and collection of third-party integrations may be less extensive than those of the LangChain/LangGraph ecosystem.51 Its features for long-term durability and complex state management are less battle-tested in production for the kind of grueling, multi-hour debugging sessions that a coding agent must endure.
Ultimately, a developer attempting to build a generalist coding agent would encounter a different set of frustrations with each of these frameworks. With LangGraph, they would appreciate the control but might struggle with the complexity and performance implications of passing large file contents through the state graph. With ADK, they would find a familiar software engineering paradigm but might feel the abstractions are better suited for inter-agent communication than the tight, intra-agent refinement loop that coding requires. With Agno, they would be drawn to the impressive performance claims but might question whether its simple, declarative structure is robust enough for the sheer complexity of the task. This journey often leads to the same conclusion: the effort required to bend a general-purpose framework to the specific, demanding will of a coding agent is often greater than the effort to build a lightweight, bespoke solution that does exactly what is needed—and nothing more.

Section 4: The Chasm of Specificity: A Comparative Analysis

The decision to build a custom framework for an AI coding agent is rooted in a fundamental mismatch between the generic abstractions provided by "buy" solutions and the highly specific requirements of the software engineering domain. This chasm is most evident when analyzing three key areas: execution control, state management, and environmental integration.

4.1 Technical Justification: Control, State, and Environment

Fine-Grained Execution Loop Control: Custom frameworks provide developers with complete, unobscured control over the agent's internal logic. Aider's Architect/Editor model is a prime example of a specialized execution loop designed to optimize for a specific problem: the differing capabilities of LLMs in reasoning versus formatted output. This bespoke pipeline allows Aider to control precisely how many LLM calls are made for a single user request, what specific context is passed to each model, and how their outputs are merged to produce the final code edit. General-purpose frameworks, by contrast, often present the agent's reasoning loop as a more monolithic or abstracted process (e.g., a single "agent" node in a graph), making such fine-tuned, multi-step reasoning more complex to implement.11
Specialized State Management: A coding task requires tracking a multifaceted and dynamic state that includes the content of multiple files, the results of test runs, linting errors, the history of failed attempts, and the agent's own evolving plan. Custom frameworks can build state management systems tailored to these specific entities. OpenHands' Event Stream is a purpose-built architecture for this, creating a perfect, auditable log of every action and observation, which is ideal for long-term reasoning and debugging.18 While general frameworks like LangGraph offer robust state management via its
StateGraph, the state is typically a generic key-value store or a list of messages. It is not inherently structured to understand the relationships between files, tests, and errors in a software project.
Tight Integration with Local Environment: For a coding agent, the local development environment is not just a source of data; it is the canvas on which it works. Aider's deep, native integration with git is a core feature, not an optional tool.4 This allows it to leverage git's powerful diffing, versioning, and rollback capabilities as a fundamental part of its operation. Building this level of seamless, low-level integration on top of a general framework, which typically treats environmental interactions as discrete, black-box "tool calls," would be less efficient and would sacrifice the tight coupling that makes the user experience fluid and intuitive.

4.2 Performance and Control: The Latency Tax

General-purpose frameworks, by their nature, introduce layers of abstraction to achieve their flexibility and broad applicability. Each of these layers, however, can impose a "framework tax" in the form of added latency and memory consumption.50 For many applications, this overhead is negligible. But for an AI coding agent, where a developer expects near-instantaneous feedback in the rapid-fire edit-lint-test loop, even small delays are disruptive.
The marketing and design of the Agno framework are built almost entirely on addressing this pain point, positioning it as a high-performance alternative to heavier frameworks and implicitly acknowledging that performance is a major concern for agent developers.48 Furthermore, developer discussions frequently highlight that while frameworks are excellent for prototyping, their "baggage" and "black box" nature can become a significant liability in performance-critical production environments.35 A custom-built framework can be ruthlessly optimized for its specific task, stripping out any unnecessary overhead to ensure the lowest possible latency in the critical developer feedback loop.

4.3 A List of Limitations: Architectural Mismatches in General Frameworks

When viewed through the lens of building a generalist coding agent, the architectural choices of general frameworks reveal several key limitations.
LangGraph:
Inefficient State Handling for Large Files: LangGraph's model involves passing the entire state object between nodes. When the state includes the contents of multiple large source code files, this can become highly inefficient in terms of memory and serialization overhead. A custom framework can work with file paths and only read/write from disk when absolutely necessary, keeping the in-memory state lean.
Risk of Uncontrolled Loops: The cyclical nature of LangGraph is a powerful feature, but it also presents a significant risk. A bug-fixing loop could get stuck repeating the same failed attempt. A custom framework can implement more domain-specific circuit breakers, such as, "If the same test suite fails three consecutive times with a similar stack trace, halt execution and ask the user for guidance".31
Generic Tool Abstraction: LangGraph's ToolNode is a generic wrapper for function calls. A custom framework can implement more specialized and intelligent action types, such as RunTests, ApplyDiff, or RunLinter, with built-in logic for parsing the specific output formats and error codes of these common development tools.
Google ADK:
Agent-Centric, Not File-Centric Abstractions: ADK's architecture is fundamentally designed for orchestrating communication and delegation between agents. The primary task of a coding agent, however, is orchestrating edits across files. The framework's core abstractions may not align well with this file-centric workflow.
Over-Emphasis on Multi-Agent Collaboration: The framework's main strengths lie in defining how multiple agents collaborate to solve a problem.38 This is often overkill for a single, powerful coding agent, and the abstractions designed for multi-agent systems may introduce unnecessary complexity.
Immaturity and Lack of Battle-Testing: As a very new framework, ADK lacks the years of community use and refinement needed to handle the vast number of edge cases and environmental quirks inherent in software development across different operating systems, languages, and project configurations.44
Agno:
Simplicity at the Cost of Depth: Agno's design prioritizes a clean, simple, and declarative interface, which is excellent for many use cases.47 However, state-of-the-art coding agents are inherently complex systems. It remains an open question whether Agno's abstractions are powerful enough to manage the deep, nested state and complex conditional logic of a long-running debugging session without requiring the developer to write the same kind of "messy glue code" the framework aims to eliminate.
Unproven Reliability for Enterprise-Scale Coding: Agno's benchmarks focus on instantiation speed and memory footprint.48 For a coding agent intended for professional use, features like rock-solid reliability, predictable behavior, and robust error handling are often more critical than raw startup speed. The framework's maturity in these "boring" but essential enterprise-grade features is less proven than that of custom solutions designed from day one to solve these problems.
The following table provides a comparative summary of how custom-built frameworks and general-purpose frameworks address the core requirements of an AI coding agent.

Requirement
Custom Frameworks (Aider, OpenHands, Devin)
General-Purpose Frameworks (LangGraph, ADK, Agno)
Filesystem & Git Integration
Native, deep, and treated as a core architectural component. Git is often used for state and versioning.
Handled via abstracted tool calls. Lacks the tight, seamless coupling of a native approach.
State Management
Bespoke and domain-specific (e.g., Event Stream, git history). Optimized for tracking files, tests, and errors.
Generic state models (e.g., key-value objects, message lists). Not inherently aware of software development entities.
Execution Loop Control
Fine-grained, with full control over the internal logic, including multi-step LLM pipelines (e.g., Architect/Editor).
Abstracted into nodes and edges. Provides control over the flow but less over the internal mechanics of each step.
Performance Profile
Optimized for low latency and minimal resource footprint to support rapid developer feedback loops.
Prone to "framework tax" (latency/memory overhead) due to layers of abstraction. Performance is a common concern.
Extensibility
Infinitely flexible, as any new logic can be coded directly. The only limit is developer effort.
Pluggable and modular, but extensions are constrained by the framework's core design and abstractions.
Ease of Prototyping
Higher initial development effort, as foundational components must be built from scratch.
Lower initial effort, as frameworks provide pre-built components for state, tools, and orchestration.


Section 5: Bridging the Gap: Counter-Examples and Hybrid Strategies

While the landscape of general-purpose, conversational coding agents is dominated by custom-built frameworks, this does not signify that general frameworks have no role to play in the broader domain of AI-powered software engineering. An analysis of notable counter-examples reveals a distinct and important pattern: general-purpose frameworks like LangGraph are being successfully adopted for well-defined, auxiliary, and workflow-driven tasks within a larger development ecosystem.

Case Study 1: Uber's "AutoCover" for Unit Test Generation

Uber's Developer Platform team has developed a tool called "AutoCover" to automate the generation of unit tests, a critical task for maintaining code quality during large-scale code migrations. This system is built using LangGraph.29
Architecture and Implementation: Uber's approach is highly sophisticated. They have constructed an opinionated internal framework called "Lang Effect," which wraps LangGraph and LangChain to integrate more smoothly with Uber's extensive internal infrastructure and build systems.54 The AutoCover system itself is a network of specialized agents orchestrated by LangGraph. This includes a "scaffolder agent" to prepare the test environment, a "generator agent" to create test cases, and an "executor agent" to run the tests and analyze coverage.54
Why LangGraph is a Good Fit: The task of "generating a unit test for a given function" is far more constrained than an open-ended request like "fix this bug." It has a clear input (a specific piece of code) and a clear, automatable success condition (the generated test compiles, runs, and increases code coverage). This type of well-defined, stateful workflow is an excellent match for LangGraph's graph-based orchestration model. The process can be modeled as a state machine: analyze code, generate test, execute test, check result, and loop if necessary. This is precisely the kind of complex but structured workflow that LangGraph is designed to handle. It is important to note, however, that this is an internal tool and is not open-source.54

Case Study 2: Replit's AI Agent for Code Generation

Replit, the popular browser-based IDE, utilizes LangGraph to power its AI code generation agent.29
Architecture and Implementation: The Replit team emphasizes a multi-agent setup that heavily incorporates human-in-the-loop capabilities. LangGraph's first-class support for streaming allows Replit to provide users with real-time visibility into the agent's actions, such as installing packages or creating files within the IDE's virtual environment.29
Why LangGraph is a Good Fit: In this case, the agent is operating within the controlled and well-defined context of the Replit IDE. Its scope of action is limited to the user's project environment. LangGraph's core strengths—robust state management for tracking the coding session, human-in-the-loop for user interaction and approval, and streaming for a transparent user experience—are ideal for this application. It is another example of using a general framework to power a specific, complex feature within a larger product, rather than as the basis for a standalone, generalist coding assistant.

Other Notable Implementations

The pattern of using LangGraph for structured, data-centric tasks extends beyond direct code generation. Elastic uses LangGraph to orchestrate AI agents for security threat detection, a workflow that involves analyzing data and identifying patterns.53
LinkedIn built an internal SQL-generating bot on LangGraph to help employees query databases using natural language.29 These examples reinforce the conclusion that LangGraph's sweet spot is the automation of complex but repeatable, stateful workflows.
The "build vs. buy" decision is therefore highly dependent on the specific task. The evidence suggests a clear divergence. For open-ended, conversational, general-purpose coding agents that must act as versatile pair-programming partners, the fine-grained control and optimized performance of a custom-built framework are currently preferred. For more structured, automatable, and repeatable sub-problems within the software development lifecycle (like test generation, documentation updates, or SQL querying), the powerful orchestration and state management capabilities of a general framework like LangGraph provide an ideal and efficient solution.
This points not to a future where one approach wins, but to a hybrid ecosystem. Engineering organizations will likely employ both types of tools: a primary, conversational coding agent (built on a custom framework) for interactive, creative, and debugging tasks, while simultaneously deploying fleets of specialized, workflow-based agents (built on general frameworks) to their CI/CD pipelines and other automated systems to handle rote tasks.

Section 6: Historical Context and Future Trajectories

The current prevalence of custom frameworks among top-tier AI coding agents is not solely a result of technical and philosophical choices; it is also a product of historical timing. The evolution of these agents has, until recently, outpaced the maturity of general-purpose agentic frameworks, making the "build" decision as much a matter of necessity as of preference.

6.1 The Timeline of Innovation: A Race Between Agents and Frameworks

An analysis of the release dates and development timelines of key agents and frameworks reveals a clear pattern: the foundational work on today's leading custom-built agents began when the general-purpose alternatives were either non-existent or significantly less mature.
Date

Framework
The rebranded framework (formerly Phidata) is actively discussed and integrated into other tools.

Note: The development of Aider was ongoing during this period, with its PyPI history showing rapid, continuous releases starting around August 2024, indicating its core architecture was likely established before the maturation of frameworks like ADK and the more controllable version of LangGraph.65
This timeline demonstrates that the core architectural decisions for agents like Devin and Aider were made at a time when a mature, off-the-shelf framework capable of meeting their complex needs simply did not exist. LangGraph was new and evolving, and Google ADK had not yet been released. Building a custom framework was the only viable path to achieving their ambitious goals. The emergence of OpenHands with its own bespoke architecture, even after LangGraph was more established, further suggests that its developers felt a custom approach was better suited to their specific vision of an auditable, event-driven system.

6.2 Future Trajectories: Convergence, Specialization, or Hybridization?

The key question now is whether this trend will continue. As general-purpose frameworks like LangGraph, ADK, and Agno mature and add more features, will new coding agents be built on top of them? The answer is likely nuanced.
The "Build" Imperative for Generalists May Remain: For flagship, general-purpose coding agents that aim to be versatile, conversational partners, the arguments for a custom build—fine-grained control, optimized performance, and the implementation of a unique architectural philosophy—will likely remain compelling. It is difficult for a general framework to provide the same level of domain-specific optimization as a bespoke solution.
The Rise of the Hybrid Ecosystem: The most probable future is not a "winner-take-all" scenario but a hybrid model. This ecosystem will likely consist of:
Generalist, Conversational Agents (Custom-Built): Developers will use these for interactive, open-ended tasks like pair programming, debugging complex issues, and architectural exploration.
Specialist, Workflow Agents (Framework-Built): These agents will be integrated into automated systems like CI/CD pipelines to handle specific, repeatable tasks such as generating unit tests, updating dependencies, writing documentation from code, or performing security scans.
Frameworks Will Continue to Evolve: The general-purpose frameworks are not static targets. LangGraph is actively adding features like node caching and pre/post model hooks to improve performance and control.66 Google ADK is rapidly building out its tool ecosystem and enterprise deployment options.38 Agno continues to push the boundaries of performance and simplicity.48 As these frameworks become more powerful and flexible, the barrier to using them for more complex, coding-related tasks will lower, likely accelerating the adoption of specialist, workflow-driven agents.
The "build vs. buy" decision for AI coding agents, which began as a matter of necessity, has now evolved into a strategic choice dictated by the agent's intended scope. The historical trend of building custom frameworks for generalist agents will likely continue, but it will be complemented by a new and growing trend of using powerful general-purpose frameworks to build an army of specialized agents that automate the toil of the software development lifecycle. The question for engineering leaders is no longer a single "build or buy," but a more sophisticated portfolio question: "Which tasks are best suited for 'build,' and which are best suited for 'buy'?"
