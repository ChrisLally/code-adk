# 1b. Framework Analysis

This section provides a detailed comparative analysis of the three primary agentic frameworks under consideration: Google ADK, Agno, and LangGraph.

## Objective

The goal is to move beyond high-level documentation and conduct a deep-dive analysis of each framework's core architecture, design philosophy, and practical capabilities. This will inform our decision on which framework, or combination of frameworks, is best suited for building our AI coding agent.

## Methodology

For each framework, we will investigate the following areas:

1.  **Core Architecture:** Analyze the fundamental design principles. Is it a state machine, a graph-based system, a library of components, or something else?
2.  **State Management:** How does the framework handle state across multiple turns and tool calls?
3.  **Control Flow:** What mechanisms are provided for directing the agent's execution path (e.g., loops, conditionals, human-in-the-loop)?
4.  **Tool Integration:** How are tools defined, integrated, and managed?
5.  **Performance:** What are the trade-offs in terms of latency, memory usage, and scalability?
