Research Prompt: Investigating Multi-Modal Open-Source Coding Agents Using Agno, LangChain/LangGraph, or Google ADK with Model Context Protocol and GitHub Integration

Objective

Explore existing multi-modal open-source coding agents implemented in Python using frameworks like Agno, LangChain/LangGraph, or Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK), with a focus on their integration with GitHub and testing environments via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Identify examples that leverage separate models for planning (e.g., reasoning, task decomposition) and code writing (e.g., generating syntactically correct code).



Research Goals

Framework Analysis: Examine the capabilities of Agno, LangChain/LangGraph, and Google ADK in supporting multi-modal coding agents, particularly their Python compatibility, multi-agent architectures, and MCP server integration.

Multi-Modal Examples: Identify open-source coding agents that use distinct models for planning and code writing, including how they orchestrate these models.

GitHub Integration: Investigate how existing agents interact with GitHub (e.g., via GitHub’s REST API) for tasks like code commits, pull requests, or repository management, using MCP servers.

Testing Environment Integration: Explore how agents interface with testing environments (e.g., pytest, CI/CD pipelines) to validate code, with MCP for tool communication.

Open-Source Tools Review: Analyze tools like OpenHands, Cline, and Aider for multi-modal capabilities, reusable components, and limitations.

Performance Insights: Evaluate the instantiation speed, memory footprint, and scalability of multi-modal agents built with these frameworks.

Code Examples: Locate Python code samples or repositories demonstrating multi-modal coding agents with GitHub and testing environment integration, using Agno, LangGraph, or ADK with MCP.

Key Questions

How do Agno, LangChain/LangGraph, and Google ADK support multi-modal coding agents, particularly in Python-based implementations?

What open-source models (e.g., via HuggingFace, LiteLLM) are used for planning versus code writing in existing multi-modal agents?

How do agents use MCP servers to interact with GitHub and testing environments?

What multi-modal features (e.g., text, images) do tools like OpenHands, Cline, and Aider offer?

How do agents ensure secure GitHub interactions, such as human-in-the-loop workflows?

What are the performance trade-offs (e.g., speed, memory) of Agno’s lightweight approach versus LangGraph’s graph-based orchestration or ADK’s enterprise features?

How do existing agents validate code in testing environments, and what role does MCP play?

Methodology

Literature Review:

Study documentation and tutorials for Agno, LangChain/LangGraph, and Google ADK, focusing on multi-agent systems and MCP integration.

Review GitHub repositories and discussions for OpenHands, Cline, Aider, and similar tools, emphasizing multi-modal features.

Search blogs, forums (e.g., Reddit, LangChain’s GitHub), and case studies for practical examples.

Framework Comparison:

Compare Agno, LangGraph, and ADK for instantiation speed, memory usage, and multimodal support, referencing claims like Agno’s ~10,000x faster instantiation.

Assess MCP compatibility and third-party tool integrations (e.g., LangChain’s tools, ADK’s LiteLLM).

Model Identification:

Identify open-source models (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Mixtral-8x7B) used for planning and code writing in existing agents.

Explore LiteLLM usage for model-agnostic integration.

Example Collection:

Find Python-based repositories or code snippets of multi-modal agents that:Use separate models for planning and coding.

Integrate with GitHub’s REST API for repository tasks.

Connect to testing environments (e.g., pytest) via MCP.

Document agent architectures and MCP usage.

Tool Analysis:

Evaluate OpenHands, Cline, and Aider for multi-modal capabilities, GitHub/testing integrations, and Python implementations.

Identify reusable components or gaps in these tools.
