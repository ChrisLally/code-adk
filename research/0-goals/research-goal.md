# Research Goal: Determine the Optimal Architecture for an AI Coding Agent

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this research is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing agentic frameworks and architectural patterns to determine the most effective, reliable, and scalable approach for building an advanced AI coding agent. We will investigate the trade-offs between different philosophies, focusing on single-agent versus multi-agent systems, and identify best practices for tool integration, model orchestration, and security.

## 2. Key Research Areas

Our investigation will be centered around the following key areas:

### 2.1. Framework Analysis

- **Comparative Study:** Conduct a deep-dive comparison of **Google ADK**, **Agno**, and **LangGraph**.
  - **Performance:** Benchmark instantiation speed, memory footprint, and overall latency.
  - **Architecture:** Analyze the core design philosophies (e.g., minimalist vs. stateful graph vs. enterprise system).
  - **Capabilities:** Evaluate native support for multi-modality, multi-agent patterns, and persistence.

### 2.2. Architectural Patterns

- **Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent:** Critically evaluate the two dominant architectural philosophies.
  - **Cognition.ai's Argument:** Investigate the "shared context" principle and the potential pitfalls of multi-agent systems where context is not fully shared.
  - **Anthropic's Approach:** Analyze the benefits of the "Planner-Executor" and "Supervisor" models for parallelizing complex research and coding tasks.
  - **Hybrid Models:** Explore architectures that combine the strengths of both approaches, such as using a primary orchestrator (LangGraph) to manage ephemeral, high-performance agents (Agno) for specific parallelizable tasks.

### 2.3. Integration and Tooling

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Assess MCP as a standard for decoupling agents from their tools.
  - Design and blueprint custom MCP servers for essential developer tools, specifically **GitHub** and **pytest**.
- **IDE & Git Integration:** Analyze how existing agents (OpenHands, Cline/Roo-Code, Aider) integrate with the developer's local environment, including Git workflows and IDE feedback loops.

### 2.4. Security and Reliability

- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Define non-negotiable checkpoints for human approval, especially for file modifications and code commits.
- **Sandboxing:** Establish best practices for executing code and running tests in isolated environments (e.g., Docker).
- **Observability:** Evaluate tools and techniques for tracing and debugging agent behavior to ensure reliability and auditability.

## 3. Guiding Questions

- What are the definitive trade-offs between a single, long-context agent and a collaborative multi-agent system for software development?
- Is it more effective to build agents from a low-level, high-control framework (LangGraph) or a high-level, feature-rich framework (Google ADK)?
- Where does a performance-oriented framework like Agno fit into the architecture? Is it a primary framework or a specialized tool for parallel tasks?
- How critical is a standardized protocol like MCP for building an extensible and future-proof agent ecosystem?

## 4. Deliverables

- A detailed report summarizing the findings of the framework and architectural analysis.
- A recommended hybrid architecture that specifies the optimal combination of framework(s), patterns, and integration protocols.
- Functional blueprints for building MCP servers for GitHub and pytest.
